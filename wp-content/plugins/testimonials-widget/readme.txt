More than one Testimonials Widget instance can be displayed at a time pulls from the `testimonials-widget` custom post type. Additionally, with shortcodes and theme functions, you can display a short or long list or rotation of testimonials. Each Testimonial Widget has its own CSS identifier for custom styling.

Widgets display content sans `wpautop` formatting. This means no forced paragraph breaks unless the content specifically contains them. You can enable `wpautop` via the "Keep whitespace?" option.

Through categories and tagging, you can create organizational structures based upon products, projects and services via categories and then apply tagging for further classification. As an example, you might create a Portfolio category and then use tags to identify web, magazine, media, public, enterprise niches. You can then configure the Testimonial Widget to show only Portfolio testimonials with the public and enterprise tags. In another Testimonial Widget, you can also select only Portfolio testimonials, but then allow web and media tags.

The single testimonial view supports image, source, title, location, email, company and URL details.

= Background & Thanks =

A big, special thank you to [Joe Weber](https://plus.google.com/100063271269277312276/posts) of [12 Star Creative](http://www.12starcreative.com/) for creating the Testimonials Widget banner. It's fantastic.

Version 2.0.0 of Testimonials Widget is a complete rewrite based upon a composite of ideas from user feedback and grokking the plugins [Imperfect Quotes](http://www.swarmstrategies.com/imperfect-quotes/), [IvyCat Ajax Testimonials](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/ivycat-ajax-testimonials/), [Quotes Collection](http://srinig.com/wordpress/plugins/quotes-collection/), and [TB Testimonials](http://travisballard.com/wordpress/tb-testimonials/). Thank you to these plugin developers for their efforts that have helped inspire this rewrite.

A cool thanks to RedRokk Library for the [redrokk_metabox_class](https://gist.github.com/1880770). It makes configuring meta boxes for your posts, pages or custom post types a snap.

Prior to version 2.0.0, this plugin was a fork of [Quotes Collection](http://srinig.com/wordpress/plugins/quotes-collection/) by [Srini G](http://wordpress.org/support/profile/SriniG) with additional contributions from [j0hnsmith](http://wordpress.org/support/profile/j0hnsmith), [ChrisCree](http://wordpress.org/support/profile/ChrisCree) and [comprock](http://wordpress.org/support/profile/comprock).

	* `bottom_text` renamed to `bottom-text`
	* `close_quote` renamed to `close-quote`
	* `display_none` renamed to `display-none`
	* `join_location` renamed to `join-location`

= 2.11.3 =

* Correct filter name `testimonials_widget_next_posts_link` to `testimonials_widget_next_posts_link_text`

= 2.11.0 =

* CSS class names are simplified. For the most part, other than `testimonialswidget_testimonial` remove `testimonialswidget_` from the CSS class name in your CSS customizations.
	* Ex: `.testimonialswidget_join` becomes `.join`
	* Ex: `.testimonialswidget_author` becomes `.author`
* Testimonials are now formatted using `blockquote` than `q` for HTML5 compliance. If you need `q` tag formatting, enable it at WP Admin > Testimonials > Settings, Compatibility & Reset tab
	* `cite` is now `div.credit`

= 2.8.0 =

* Deprecated
	* `hide_author` now `hide_source`
* Removed filters `testimonials_widget_options_update`, `testimonials_widget_options_form`
	* Use `testimonials_widget_validate_settings` and `testimonials_widget_settings` instead
* Renamed variable and related class `widget_text` to `bottom_text`

= 2.7.3 =

* Quotes are no longer handled via `q`, `p:before`, or `p:after` CSS. It's handled via `.testimonialswidget_testimonial .testimonialswidget_open_quote:before` and `.testimonialswidget_testimonial .testimonialswidget_close_quote:after`
* This change was made to keep consistency in how quotes were managed and to reduce the number of exception cases. In the end, this is simpler.

= 2.7.0 =

* Quotes with `keep_whitespace=true` aren't applied via CSS `.testimonialswidget_testimonial q` tag anymore, but `.testimonialswidget_testimonial q p:first-child:before` and `.testimonialswidget_testimonial q p:last-child:after`
* Widget testimonial `p` tags are no longer CSS `display: inline`, `display: block` as expected

= 2.4.1 =

= 2.0.0 =

	* Class `testimonialswidget_company` replaces `testimonialswidget_source`
	* Class `testimonialswidget_source` replaces `testimonialswidget_author`
	* The tighten widget display up, p tags within q are displayed inline.
* JavaScript
	* The JavaScript for rotating testimonials is moved to the footer. As such, your theme requires `wp_footer()` in the footer.
* Shortcode options
	* `hide_source` replaced by `hide_url`
	* `hide_author` replaced by `hide_source`
* Testimonials
	* Migration from the old custom table to new custom post type is automatically done. Import might take a few moments to complete.
	* Company, URL and email details are attempted to be identified and placed properly based upon the original author and source fields. The company is "guessed" from the `author` field when there's a ", " or " of " context. If the `source` is an email, it's saved as such. Otherwise, it's assumed to be a URL.
	* Public testimonials are saved as Published. Non-public testimonials are marked as Private.
* Widget options
	* "Show author" and "Show source" options are replaced by "Hide source" and "Hide URL" respectively. There's no backwards compatibility for these changes. 
	* Default `min-height` is now 250px than 150px.

== Beta Testers Needed ==

I really want Testimonials Widget and Testimonials Widget Premium to be the best WordPress plugins of their type. However, it's beyond me to do it alone.

I need beta testers to help with ensuring pending releases of Testimonials Widget and Testimonials Widget Premium are solid. This would benefit us all by helping reduce the number of releases and raise code quality.

[Please contact me directly](http://aihr.us/contact-aihrus/).

Beta testers benefit directly with latest versions, a free 1-site license for Testimonials Widget Premium, and personalized support assistance.
