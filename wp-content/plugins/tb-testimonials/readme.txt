-
This plugin lets you manage testimonials as a separate type of information in your WordPress blog, which makes it easier to include them in other blog posts and pages.

Less technical description by Jacob Share :)

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Upload the plugin folder `tb-testimonials` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Click Testimonials menu item and add a testimonial. It's below the Posts menu item. The post title is where you put the testimonial author's name.
4. Use the shortcode generator button ( 2 speach bubbles ) in the visual editor to add a shortcode for testimonials to any post or page on your site.
5. Activate widget if you want to use it.
6. Create a custom testimonial.php if you want to display permalinks differently from single.php.
